    <h3>SpaceSloths</h3>
    <h3>Short Pitch</h3>
    SpaceSloths is about our passion for space habitation by sending Sloths to Mars.
    <h3>Long Pitch</h3>
    The Human race is increasing it's population size at an alarming rate. We aren't seeing
    the consequences yet, but in future years we may. SpaceSloths is dedicated to
    coming up with the solution. A solution with an end goal of sending Humans to
    live on mars. Of course, our lives are too important to put in danger. So, until
    mars is safe enough for humans, we will use Sloths. Sloths because, well.. what
    else do they do? SpaceSloths sends sloths to mars and we study how they live on the
    planet.
